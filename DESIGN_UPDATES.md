# Design Improvements & Responsiveness Updates

## 1. Header & Navigation (Navbar)
- **Glassmorphism**: Enhanced the "frosted glass" effect (`backdrop-blur-xl`) for a more premium look.
- **Floating Design**: Kept the navbar floating but refined its transition on scroll.
- **Mobile Menu**: Replaced the simple fade-in menu with a **full-screen slide-down overlay** with staggered animation for menu items.
- **Hover Effects**: Added a "pill" shape background and smooth color transitions for desktop navigation links.
- **Logo**: Added a subtle lift/glow effect on hover.

## 2. Hero Section
- **Creative Buttons**: Added a "shimmer" effect that runs through the buttons on hover, giving them a premium shine.
- **Glow Effects**: Added subtle shadow glows to the primary call-to-action buttons.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensured the text sizes (`text-display`) and layout (stacking on mobile) are optimized for all devices.

## 3. General Aesthetics
- **Scrollbar**: Customized the browser scrollbar to match the Gold/Blue color scheme.
- **Animations**: Added `shimmer` and `slide-down` animations to the configuration.
- **Typography**: Ensured the custom font `Lama Sans` is used consistently.

## 4. Technical Updates
- Updated `tailwind.config.js` to include new animations (`shimmer`) and shadows (`orange-glow`).
- Updated `index.css` for global scrollbar styling.
